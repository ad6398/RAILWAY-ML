Indian Railways — train running very late - It was 22nd of March 2018 I have started my journey from Anand Vihar to KATIHAR by the so called AC super fast special train Arunachal express 02412. Me really very disappointed to see that the situation of Indian railways is getting worse and worse day by day despite change of government. I am writing this complain but not sure whether this would reach to the correct officials or concerned departments. And if it reaches to the concerned department by chance then also any corrective measures would be taken or not. Why always we the people suffer and not the so called ministers and govt. Officers?Our train could not reach the first stoppage, Kanpur in 9 hrs can anyone imagine. Would railways take the responsibility and compenstate all those who are in loss due to the delayed train. Shame on Indian railways and all those who do fake promises

Pathetic train as it halted at most of the station for passing inspite of being late. This train charges fees for superfast which is not accepted as train is not at all superfast. Request you to investigate and help traveller so that they dont suffer such way. Regards, Preetham bangera

Indian Railways — train no.12262 food and hygiene to improve - My experience and suggestions during travel on 07th march in train 12262 coach b2 seat 28 is as follws. 1. Toilets converted from bio to normal though stickers shows no change. 2. Toilet hygiene is extremely poor will cause health issue. 3. To use bio toilet, passangers need to be educated and cleaning staff vigilance required. 4. Food quality deteriorated, suggested variety food menu online to choose menu during booking. 5. Caterer staff should be trained to not beg for tips and should not compromise giving quality services. 6. Inspection team to be deputed to monitor qualily and hygiene.

Indian Railways — partial receipt of booked packages and fear of lost packages - Sir,  We would like to bring to your notice our plight at nizamuddin parcel office, apathy of the staff, consequent callousness and hardship caused to us. We have booked two packages [prr no: [protected] and [protected]], each containing 8 items from visakhapatnam to nizamuddin on 2/3/2018. These packages contained wooden cot parts for furniture. Messages were sent after booking of these packages. However, later no communication was made to us regarding loading or unloading of these packages. Anxious to know the status, we reached the parcel office on 7th march 2018 at 11:00 am to enquire. Then the drama unfolded, we were made to run a marathon from one platform to another and godown and so on. Nearly after 3 hours, some items (7 out of 16 pieces from 2 packages) were found. With respect to the remaining, we were told to contact visakhapatnam parcel office where the booking was done. We could not do that immediately. We sought a remedy to our travails from the unrelenting staff [sh s. D. Meena/cpsr, sh ganga ram/ delivery clerk and 6th no. Platform parcel clerk] who were merciless.  Out of despair we approached the station director who directed sh. Sd meena, cpsr to release the received items (7 in no.) after duly filling in the unloading status in computer. The same was done after further 2:30hrs delay lasting till evening (5:30 or 5:45 pm). We also complained about the attitude of the delivery clerk (Sh. Ganga ram) to the cpsr in writing to let him know of our hardship. Notwithstanding these events, our packages haven’t been completely delivered yet. Therefore, we would request you let us know the shipping status of the remaining 9 items and also direct concerned staff to trace those packages and deliver to us. Thanking you

Indian Railways — misbehavior and misleading by tte - The train gangakaveri express (Train no.12670) was delayed by 3 hours from its actual time of 10.40 am at jabalpur station on 13.02.2018. When i entered in the coach ha1 and approached my berths a/1 & a/3, it was pre-occupied by passengers. However, i searched for tte/in charge and met tte-mr. Mohammed shabbir whose name plate was missing, further afterwards he asked me my pnr no. And he scrolled the reservation chart and said only one seat is reserved in the name of mrs. Varsha kharpate (My wife). Afterwards he miss guided us and took us to b5 coach (Iiird ac) and offered us two lower berths. When i repeatedly asked him that sir the tickets are of 1st ac why you have allotted us b5 (Iii rd ac) then in an arrogant manner he replied to me that you have iiird class tickets and humiliated me in front of all passengers. Further, after repeated and polite request of mine he took us to our allotted seats in coach ha1 (1st ac) and said to the passengers who were seating on our berth to vacate the seats. The tte behaved like he is the owner of indian railways, mis-guided us and has very low knowledge of reservation chart. Meanwhile, in the whole process we have to search him again and again along with luggage in my hand. Further, i am a heart patient and had undergone cabg (Bypass) surgery and knee surgery, also my wife is bp patient. Suppose in this whole process of exertion and miss-treatment if something would have happened to us who would be held responsible?. Please compensate us and take necessary action on the concerned officer (Mr. Mohammed shabbir) at earliest. Please take immediate action in this regard otherwise only one option would be left with me to go to consumer forum for trouble and lack of service Further, i had filed a complaint against this case in railway’s coms (Complaint no.-w/ne/bsb/[protected] portal on 13.02.2018 and last time when i checked the complaint status it was written that the complaint is closed and further reply will be given on my address but it’s been 13 days we have not received the decision copy. I have also sent a letter to sr. Dcm, jabalpur on 24.02.2018 stating that i have not received the decision copy since the final decision was taken by him in complaint. My son also tweeted regarding the same to you on 23.02.2018 at 5.24 pm.

Indian Railways — punctuality of train 01663 - Date[protected], train 01663 scheduled arrival time at pune was 10:45 am but it got delayed by almost 4 hours and arrived pune station at around 2:40 pm. Also whole train was vacant while during booking the tickets it was showing waiting list. And now this train is running 8 hours late, this is really disappointing. Train is standing at outer areas unnecessarily where we can not even have dinner as there is nothing outside. All other trains which were scheduled after 7 hours of this train have been crossed but this train is still standing unnecessarily. This is really pathetic. Please refund our amount as this is the wastage or our money and time. Also we are not gonna book this train again.  Please take action and refund the amount
Indian Railways — railways producing too much plastic waste from water bottles - Hello sir/madam, In the several premier trains like shatabdi, rajdhani express etc.. For every passenger 1 litre water is provided in a plastic bottle as a compliment during travel. This produces 1000s of plastic bottle waste everyday. The railways, should stop providing water bottles to passengers and encourage the passengers to bring their own water bottles.  Railways, can provide clean water dispensed from huge cans in the train compartments. As passengers carry water in other trains, they can bring their own water and use in the journey.  Plastic generated daily from railways, does not go well with the swach bharath campaign that is being done all over india. If we calculate the amount of plastic bottles generated every year as waste from railways, it goes to millions.. Please stop providing water is use and throw water bottles. Thanks,  Thenmozhi arunan

 On 25/2/2018 we were travelling from allahabad to guwahati along with three ladies and two of them are senior citizens. Due to my mother who is 78age and has walking problem, we borded at mugalsarai at 01:37 hours (Midnight) instead of allahabad as we have confirmed tickets of rajdhani 12424 (Two tier); because the rajdhani stops for 10minits at mugalsarai instead of 3 minute stoppage at allahabad. Unfortunately we couldn't informed thus the rule of 24 hours earlier but  at mugalsarai station verbally i 've informed to the station manager 4 hours before and he assured that for one station its not an issue. As we entered the train our all seats has been already occupied by other pesengers, when i enquired the matter about our seats with the ttc (Mr. Y. K. Rana) he misbehaved with us, by using unconstitutional languages, moreover he threaten us to thrown out  at the next station by the support of those pesengers whom he has alloted our seats  against bribe (Taken money from those unauthorised passenger without issuing any proper railway receipts). After lot of hurdles ttc later somehow convinced and we have managed to get back our seats. During these period about more than an hour both the senior citizen ladies were somehow managed to sit on other passengers seats. My mother is an arthritis patient and she is depends on wheel chair mostly. This is very shameful and unasspectable such type of behaviour from a duty officer who also was under drunken condition (Mr. Y. K. Rana ttc). Therefore, this is my humble request to kindly take an proper action against the said person so that he learnt a lesson. Else he will be continuing such ill-treating behaviour with future citizens/passengers in his further duties. ThanksAshim b bordoloi, [protected]Mobile)Pnr no [protected].

 The waiting rooms in howrah station is too bad. The seats are dirty even in the ac waiting hall. The seats are full of bed bugs. Hardly one can sit for some minutes.Proper cleaning of the seat with pesticides should be done.Many kids and old age people require to sit which is completely impossible in that unhygienic area.Please pay heed to the concern as howrah is a large station and too much in demand for people travelling to different places.   
 The train kriya yoga express (18615) has been delayed more than 10-12 times as i made my journey since july 2017 to feb 2018.

 ToThe minister of railwaysGovt. Of indiaDear respected sir, I am currently traveling by the train no 12769 from mpl to sc in b1 coach and my seat number is 61 (Pnr [protected]). Its 11:00 pm now.I was sleeping and suddenly realised that somebody was hitting very hard from the other side of the shutter (Its between ac coach and sleeper coach) of our coach. We guessed there might be some emergency like accident or someone was in crisis on the other side of the shutter. As the sound was very hard we rushed and informed the attendant of our coach mr. Veeraswamy who was having rest on the front side of our coach. The moment mr. Veeraswamy opened the shutter we realised that one railway staff (Mr. Raghuram nayak) was hitting the shutter very hard. Along with me there was another passenger mr. Pratap reddy (B1 39) who witnessed the whole incident.This incident has not only created a chaos and panic but was also harming the physical asset of the railways. We were shocked to see the insensitivity of a railway staff towards the assets of the railways and also insensitivity towards the comfort of the customers.We expect you to take suitable action in this regard and also inform us as citizens of this country about the action taken.Look forward to your action!Regards, Suman laskar

 I am currently traveling in mudgaon-nizamuddin rajdhani express, the condition of washrooms and the cleaning service here is so bad that it difficult to breathe. How is the passenger even supposed to spend 25 hours in these conditions. The passengers travelling as well as the cleaning staff should be more alert on the cleanliness status and sanitary conditions in the moving train.This right here is an example of incompetent staff and equally incompetent services.One of the premium trains of the indian railways and this is what the passenger gets after paying more than 3500 for a ticket. It's a shame for the government and more so for the people who represent the railways.   
 Sir i’m a resident of jangpura extension a block. We just moved here and we find it very disturbing to hear the train horns all the time, every 15 minutes. We have elderly people at home who are unable to get sound sleep and the kids find it disturbing while studying. The train horns are very high pitched and loud. If it is possible to make this area a quiet zone, we would be really grateful to youThanks   
 I mr. Sharath. R. Nair residing at pezhummoottil thekathil, manjinikara, omalloor (Po) pathanamthitta (Dist) kerala, with my family travelled from chenganur (Cgnr) kerala to gandhidham (Gimb) gujarat, in train no -16336 – nagerkovil – gandhidham exp on 20th feb 2018 1900 hrs in coach a1- second ac (2a), pnr no : [protected].On 21st early morning it found that two of our baggage’s found cut from the bottom and the materials packed in the bags are lying out side while checking it seen that the bag were cut by rats and the same was reported to tte on duty in the compartment that time, no responses that these are not in our duty to looking after the luggage of the passenger. We then reported this matter at another tte on duty at madagaon station and then purchase some new bags from their and repack the materials for further safety for handing. Looking into the above matter :- (A)	 railway has to compensate the financial loss got me on my travel and the loss of materials in my baggage. (B)	 take necessary action against the railway staff on duty in that train on the above date for none attending the passenger’s safety during their travel - none looking such costly travelling compartment for passenger luggage safety. (C)	this is why peoples are avoiding travel by train and using air for comfort travel. (D)	 hence i request to your offices to take necessary action from your side and also intimate the progress in this subject for our records and further reference and necessary action in future to avoid this kind issue to anyone else.Hope you will co operate with us for further communication.Also indian railway earning money but no safety & good facility providing to passengers.As on date first ac, second ac, third ac all are as same as general class, only one difference in fare charge, balance all area same.Thanking you. (Sharath. R. Nair)

 Hooliganism behavior by two wheeler parking contractor staff.I was surprise to saw that parking contractor staff was not follow price chart prescribed by railway. They were charging just double charges as per prescribed rates. When someone opposes it, they quarrel. 29th nov, 2017 was the day when i first time complained for this matter to commercial manager jodhpur railway and hand over my grievance to dy. Station master (Commercial) mr. Mahindra mathur (+[protected], he said that we are getting regular complains regarding it & assured that this time will be charge penalty and if he found any more with same activity we will eliminating contract.On 18th feb. 2018 i had put my vehicle in parking stand and got the receipt for the same, receipt do not printed as per the rates prescribed in chart. Even railway had provided them posh machine but they are not using it. On 19th feb. 2018 i came back and take my vehicle, parking stand contractor said me to pay rs 40 for two days @ rs 20 per day whereas according to prescribed rates on board it should be rs 10 per day and rs 20 for two days. I said this to contractor, he said that if railway has no money to change the board what we can do, it is old rates, now rates are changed and board is still not changed by railway.I complain the same to station master (Commercial) they again assured me this will not happen next time…..In fact a contractor (Pramod meena +[protected] cannot do this all without support of railway staff. Need to take immediate action and cross check with intervals that contractor is charging correct amount, using posh machine, he should have fear of eliminating, not just penalty of rs 3000 in a month which is less that his extra earning of one day (300 vehicle x rs 10 per day).I had attached application and receipt. I have also video recording if require.

 Hi i am mohit vinod shah residing in sangli. Recently i travelled to gujrat by gandhidham express and i noticed robberies of belongings of passengers. Robberies included luggages, expensive cell phones, ladies hand bags, men wallets, etc. Nearly 18 to 20 such incidents took place from kalyan to satara stations. This cases are increasing day by day. There is no security in trains. I think it's responsibility of indian government to secure passengers and let them travel safely and happily. And passengers have to face lots of problems because of these incidents. And also passengers are now afraid of travelling by train because of no security. So there is need to provide tight security and secure passengers.  Please take action against it as soon as possible. Though i was not a victim of robbery but i can understand feelings and problems of victims who are facing these problems. Details of train i was travelling are as follows:Train no.: 16506/16505Train name: gandhidham expressDate: 18/2/18  20/2/18Pnr no. : [protected] s7 8, 12 [protected] s9 13, 16 I hope next time when i travel i will not come across these problems.

 I was travelling along with my family to tirupathi from khammam by train (No: 12762 (Karimnagar-tirupathi sf express)) on 15th feb 2018. We boarded the train at 11:45 pm in khammam. My mother was sleeping in berth no:25 (Lower) in s8 compartment. Around 1:30 am at vijayawada outskirts train stopped for few minutes and the incident of chain snaching from my mother's neck has been happened. The stolen chain value is around 1 lakh (36 grams of gold).We tried to file an fir in vijayawada grp station but due to lack of time (Train halted for 5 mins) they refused to take fir from us. They told us to file it in tirupathi railway station. There we complained the incident to grp office and they refused saying that vijayawada does not fall under their juridiction. They just took the incident on a plane paper and told us to post to vijayawada.Please probe this matter as soon as possible. My mother got injuries on her neck and she is still mentally disturbed.

 The train no: 17643, circar express, between chennai egmore & kakinada. This train is arriving late by 2 to 3 hrs to kakinada every day. & all the a/c coaches are very badly maintained & bed bugs & cockroaches every where. Due to late arrival every all the further plans for the passenger are delayed. As there is no pantry car facility, small childrens are very much affected, as they are not getting morning breakfast & food sold out side vendors are not hygine. This express??? Train is running like passenger train, stopping at all small stations & stand a side, leaving path to other express trains. Railway management must look into this issue immediately, as this is the only direct train connectivity between chennai & kakinada.

My pnr no is [protected] my train number is 12589 which is canceled on 14th february which is also my travel date.

 Indian railways is a no 1 company as we know. But nowadays there was a big problem like train late, toilet not cleaning, no sufficient water, dusty bed roll, etc. This is a fundamental issues, do not ignore it. Try to understand and serve better, otherwise pm take action.New jalpaiguri (Njp) is a most valuable station in eastern railways. But there is no infrastructure to in and out the train frequently. Passengers are waiting on platform hrs and hrs, but the station master or his staff has not help or announces properly. The train is waiting 2 nos. Of stoppage before but passengers seen that the platform of njp station is vacant. So why this type of nuisance. The station master is not capable and he was the responsible.

After crossing toronto train only salem yeshwanthpur train will be given green signal. On behalf of passenger we bring to your notice that due to various chilly reasons like toronto passage, non existence of empty plat forms out of existing 6numbers at yeshwanthpur southern west railway never keeps functuality of its reach at yeshwanthpur for more then 5 years as evident from data collected by passenger forum. The lethargic inordinate delays on salem yeshwanthpur trains were fully absent during short tenure of sadhananda gowda as a railway minister. The public is not convinced of ongoing disorders in functuality as it affects revenue of daily on traveling employees at private factories of bangalore. Please allocate for cbi enquiry on internationally enforced delay by bangalore division time management group to find out actual truth and make appropriate corrective discipline actions on erring officials PassengerRaja   
 There is a ttec in bidhannagar railway station. I don't know his name. He is short height and dark. This particular ttec is the head ttec of bidhannagar as claimed by him. He is taking fines from passengers even if the passenger has a valid ticket. He says that the ticket is not valid. He is also encouraging other ticket examiners to do so. There is a lady who is their madam is also helping them. If a passengers do not pays then they threatens the passenger.This particular ttec and his superior lady is the head of all these wrong doing.Later from their conversation i came to understand that they are doing so to fulfill a target of 2500/- per day.They don't serve for the complete duty hours. They work for an hour or so, fine innocent passengers and leave the place.There are a few very helpful ticket examiner who helps the passenger. I think railway ministry should take proper step against these wrong doers.

 I had book two tickets for my parents on 3rd december 2017, both tickets are in rac quota i. E. Rac 2 and rac 3under pnr no. - [protected] and journey date is 11th feb, 2018 from jalgaon to tatanagar. My parents are come under senior citizen category, as per my knowledge they have to get lower berths as per rule, but my mother only got the lower berth and my papa hadn't. As well their coaches are also different, one is in b1/54/ub and another in b2/28/lb.in between b1 and b2, there were two coaches a1 and a2. I am really surprised with these arrangements by railway, it is really humiliating the passengers especially the senior citizen. Please do something to improve the services because this problem my father travel in b2 only in seating mode throughout the journey. What is the meaning of reservation?

 I'm travelling in train no 12970 jaipur coimbatore express today from chennai and got into ladies compartment at the rear end of the train since there was only one ladies compartment at the end. When i got in to the compartment i saw a big crowd of gents and ladies. Gents had occupied most of the seats in upper and lower births. I asked them to give seat for my mother and myself and informed them that it is ladies compartment. They argued that its not. I asked them to look at the board. Then they said even if its written as ladies its not meant for only ladies and they refused to get up. I called the rpf toll free number and talked to one person he asked me to check for a guard and i gave the phone to a guard who was passing by. They talked each other for a while. I conveyed him the issue and he asked me to adjust as there is no ladies in through trains. So i asked him the purpose of the board and this specific compartment. He started shouting at me and asked the gents and ladies to adjust and he said nothing can be done. So many lady passengers are standing here including myself. I understood that there is no use for the ladies compartment in our indian railway and rules are different for different trains. Iam feeling so ashamed to travel like this. Being a lady iam feeling so embarassed. There is no right for ladies to question and no use for the so called rpf and other authorities. If the rule he said is correct then i request indian railway to please remove the board 'ladies' and make it as general.

 Dear sir, This is to bring to your kind notice about the pathetic condition of the pune local service. There are few things that have really concerned me which are highlighted below:1) i am a regular first class passenger in the local train between talegoan dabhade to shivaji nagar. Now a days, the train is overcrowded in the first class compartment also and many unauthorised passengers holding second class tickets or even without tickets travel in first class compartments. There is practically no checking at all. I have not seen any tc's or any other officers checking tickets in the first class which results in many unwanted passengers boarding the train. I have seen many drunk people sleeping in the seats without any fear, also there have been many reports of pick pockets in the first class. Many times one can see unauthorised passengers sitting and genuine ticket holders standing. After 6 pm i have seen railway employees telling people to board the first class compartment as other compartments are crowded. During peak time the first class is as crowded as the general compartment and i have also seen many college kids enjoying hanging near the enterance and sitting comfortably when asked i was told that tc's dont come in first class.2) many unauthorised railway employees (Even the class iv and kalasi) people are travelling in first class compartment and many times sitting while passengers who genuinely pay huge amount stand in the crowd on the corridors.It is sad to see the state in which the once great indian railway has fallen too. I understand that you might be short staffed but this shouldn't stop your employees to atleast check the first class compartment once a day. If a guy who pays 10rs for a ticket or without ticket is seating in first class why am i paying for the first class ticket. When a drunk can sleep on the entire seat who is to stop someone from stealing or stabbing anyone if they know one is there to punish them. This is a serious concern to the safety of the passengers and for the money that we pay. I really don't want to pay for a first class ticket when i see people paying 10rs and enjoying the same comfort. I have seen many complains have been registered regarding this but no action has been taken i guess pune railway board would need to homicide to wake them up. Until something happens no one wakes up that the sad truth about humans now a days. It is best to just not travel by local if the government just expects you to pay the fair and not pay any attentions to the safety of the public. I am going to consider not travelling in first class and i recommend everyone to do the same or indian railway should remove the first class compartment so that everyone is one the same playing field.   
 The escalators are not working in the chintadripet station for the past 3 months to my knowledge. It is very pathetic to see people walking on the escalator. The entire railway station seems to have a poor maintenance. The entire place looks unclean. This may seem to be a small problem but every small issues causes large ones. The station is just 20 yrs old but it will get worn out if it is not maintained properly. I dont know whether proper maintenance is done but as a common man i feel it is poorly maintained.

 Dear team, I already raised a complain (Ref no : s/er/hwh/[protected] on unauthorized entry of passengers in reserved coaches.I was travelling from barddhaman jn (Bwh) to malda town (Mldt), pnr no :[protected] (Class type: 2s) (Train no : 13011) on 16 jan 2018. Berth details : d1/57 and d1/60.As where the coach was not given (Neither in display board nor through announcement) before the arrival of the train we are not aware where the partciular coach will come.Once the train reached the station we (Myself and my wife) started running through the busy platform and luckily got the coach, but unable to enter into the coach as it was full with general passengers who doesn't have any reservation ticket.in front of our eyes one old passenger fell down to get into the train. However we reached our reserved seat post 10 mins entering the coach due to huge rush of unauthorized passengers.Post reaching the seat i asked the passengers occupying my confirmed seat to get up but he refused and we have to stand and request him. The whole compartment was supporting him because all are in the same ship (No one have reserved tickets).No tte / rpf staff was present in the coach and no one came to check our tickets. My question is if i am paying the extra amount to get the service from you why i am not getting it. Why we have to suffer so much in a journey. Requesting your assurance and help so that such situations should not happen and only authorized passengers should get into reserved coaches.Regards, Argha misra[protected]/[protected]

 Today's bangalore-kochuveli (16315) express reached kyj at 6.45 am. It was held at the station up to 7.07 and malabar exp (16630) which was arrived later at 6.51 am was given signal to leave kyj first. Kochuveli express has only one stop before destination (Kollam). But the malabar express is having stops at karunagappally, sasthamkotta, kollam, paravur, varkala, kadakkavur, chirayankil, murukkumpuzha and kazhakkurram before corssing kochuveli station. Thus this foolish decision of the sm caused in the unwanted trailing of 16315 behind malabar express. Please take urgent necessary action against the officials who created this unwanted situation and inconvenience to the passengers. 16316 (Kochuveli - bangalore) is also used to trail behind nyj-kottayam passenger from kollam jn regularly.

 SirI had booked a discover motorcycle from, Asansol to ypr on 03/01/2018.The parcel office asansol, has no number, by which, i can track the parcel. They said, you will receive a call, to come & take the parcel. I had given all required details including phone numbers. No call came, after a few days i called ypr parcel office, nobody received the call. The next day as i went to ypr parcel office, i was charged 1786 as what?? No explanation from the officers. I asked, no information or call came from the railway parcel office? Reply was, we don't call anybody. So how would i know, whether the parcel has arrived or no. Due to no information from the railway, i had to pay rs. 1786. I have written a complaint at ypr station. I have all bills. I request a refund of the same, as it was not my mistake. Thanks.

 On 11/12 jan.2018 night at about 23.45 hrs., stray dogs chased a cow on right side and other cow also chased by stray dogs, suddenly came running from leftside in front of my bike. I dashed the running cow and i falled on road. While i was getting up, group of 4-5 dogs attacked me and one of the caught my left leg. I got up and protected myself from them.  I visited railway hospital and got medical treatment including 2 injections. 2 more injections to be taken on 14 and 17th jan.18.  I request the authorities to control the unauthorised movement o animals cow and buffalows on road from danteswar area to tarsali ring road. The owners on these animals leave them on road in nights. Both animals and human ply on road at god's mercy. The animal owners know very well that the authorities donot check during nights so they leave cow and buffalows venturing on road. S. R. Varma.

 Trains are always delayed and informed late even online tracking system is in efficient. This time it's 12618 from kalyan dated 16/07/2017This result into more passengers waiting in platform and hence increasing the rush ad probability of more littering and unhealthy conditions caused by passengers.Also loss of time is a big deal if we value our time. Citizens could be more productive if they get good value for their time.

I (Dr. Rajesh c m) came to know that the parcel items were gone to the last destination (Allepy). Please note the above complaint and take necessary action immediately, so that i receive the parcel at mas station as soon as possible.

I request the person who is incharge of all these to take necessary action and to come with a proper solution for these type of problems faced by the public.RegardsDr. Rajesh c m   
 @sureshpprabhu sir the train no 12414 from jammu (Jat) to ajmer (Ali) never reaches on time at rajgarh (Rhg), bandikui (Bki), dausa (Do) and gandhi nagar (Gadj) stations. Train daily detarts right time from rewari (Re) junction but never reaches on scheduled time at above mentioned stations. Since it is a super fast train, but there is no priority for this train. Railway only charges extra money on the name of super fast service. Every day this train stops at alwar (Awr)/mahwa (Mww)/malakhera (Mkh)/dhigawara (Dgw) for more than 30 min.The train always reaches 30 to 45 min late on rajgarh, bandikui, dausa and gandhi nagar railway station.Please instruct the divison to care about this train as it is a super fast train

 I am travelling from bandra terminus to jaipur in 19297 on 11 july 2017.Someone stole my bag in which my phone xoloq600s was there my wallet was in the bag and a power bank i immediately called 182 but no answer from them so i tweeted suresh prabhu and railway ministry of india in my wallet i had my driving license college id cards 400 cash. After the tweet i tried to block my vodafone number which was stolen but couldn't able to make call so i asked my friends at jaipur to get in touch with vodafone. They informed me that in order to block the sim i have to present a copy of fir at store. I am currently travelling in train so at present vodafone is not blocking my card my sling bag is missing with a power bank, my other phone, and my wallet which had 400 raand my id cards and my driving license in it.   
 This is on behalf of all the regular passengers in barasat local and the other affected ones. I required to go for coaching from bidhannagar road station and i returned by barasat local that departs from sealdah at a time of about 8:45 p. M. Which is not the expected time. When it comes to dumdum junction station at delays for an average of more than 10 minutes. This is felt as a kind of harassment by the passengers who return to their homes. One of the regular passengers tell that the only solution for this is violence which the passengers should do by throwing stones and no solution can be brought by any formal request. And the number of trains and the space inside trains is extremely small to adequate the large and huge crowd it is a need to increase the number of trains. If no solution can be brought by such formal request then i would also be the believer that violence by passengers would solve the problem and not the formal request.

 Pnr:[protected], train:12022, doj:09-07-17Dear sir/madam i travelled with the above ticket on barbil howrah jan shatabdi express form tata to howrah. The train reached howrah at 22.00 hrs where as the scheduled arrival is 20.50 hrs. All the sites that give train running status are showing that the train reached howrah station at 21:05 hrs. This is highly misleading stuff for people who will undertake a second train journey. Also i have been travelling on the same route on the same train for two times a month. Every time i find that the arrival time at howrah station is quite different from the actual one.   
 Quality of seat in railway specially side lower seat is very bad. Nobody can sleep on them. As we all know we have joint two part of seat to make it suitable for sleep. But past many journey i have noticed that both part of seat not at same level. So it's very uncomfortable to sleep on them.Hight is also a issue in them. A person like me with hight of 5'10 ft. Not able to sleep on it.Kindly do needful.

 On 07.07.17 9 am - Beach to Tirumalpur train no. 40701 departed on going to Tirumalpur at 9am from Chengalpattu RS and reached Palur station at 9.20 am. In Palur station, this train detained upto 10.20 am without any announcements by Palur station and reached Kancheepuram east stn by 10.50 am. The schedule time to reach at Kancheepuram is at 9.35 am, 1 hour 15 minutes late. A lot of inconviniences to daily official commuters to Kancheepuram to attend offices. On enquiry it is noted that one Container train was standing in one line at Walajabad to carry goods, hec3 crossing of two trains was not possible at Walajabad RS. It is to say here that Railways started its goods carrying business without any additional arrangements and detaining passenger trains more than hours. Please note that the indiscipline is too high. Higher Authorities have to solve this issue else it will be taken up with highest officials of Indian Railways.   
 Hi, right now I m in Shramjeevi express, it's such a bad experience to be here in the 3rd AC compartment of the train, it's B3 n the last coach after the guard of the train, u can understand the condition.. no water is available in the train, from noon no vendor came for tea or coffee as it is the last coach n it is not linked to other coaches, the worst thing is that water supply is too bad n the water which is there is so dirty that it can cause infection. I don't understand why Indian railways are not providing can good services when they r taking a good amount for it. Today how much difficulty we faced we only knew as there was no platform for us to reach the coach it was outside he limit of the platform, plz tell me that I m having an injury in my leg now a n I have a baby also was it possible for us to run with the luggage, to reach the coach? N what next, no water in summer, how to get water when the coach is not reaching on any station platform n no vendor is coming. I have experienced these type of worst services before also. Indian railways needs improvement.

 I am a doctor by profession & frequently travel by HWH-BBN Janshatabdi exp (12021 UP/ 12022 DN). It is the only train connecting Howrah-Barbil, but recently for  last 6 (six) months we have faced few problems:-(1) The down train (12022) reached to Howrah everyday late by 1-2 hours on an average. It had become a regular practice and very difficult for all the passengers especially for senior citizens / ladies / kids when it reached Howrah at about 11 / 11-30 pm at night.(2) Although it is a 'Shatabdi' group train and fare is much higher than the normal exp / superfast exp, but the seats of AC coaches / toilets & food quality is not up to the mark.(3) If train stoppage timing is increased to 3-4 mins at Noamundi instead of 1min, it will be helpful for a good no. of passengers, especially senior citizens.   
 Today at purulia station when i cut my ticket, in ticket counter i gave fare of 10 rupees (Consisting of small 1 rupee coin 5 pice & a 5 rupee coin) at 5:30pm the older lady who was sitting in the counter refuse to take my 1 rupee coin although the govt. Stictly told that the coins are valid. She told me to stand in side untill my coin is given to another passenger. She misbehaves with me..

Hey kay prabhuji! Pl dont change your rule for half ticket but pl change it for 2 half tickets to give them one sleeper atleast.. I am not asking for myself but for all 125crore deshvashiyo ke liye. Once again pl change your new rule as u dont want to cheat indian passengers.

 Thanks for partial suggestions of past in menu card in each cubicles to save passengers from exorbitant charging of food articles by vendors, as no cash memos are given to customers even today. The menu chart is pasted in compartment' entry, not in each cubicle, the price column has been intentionally scratched, needless to indicate the culprits, the vendors. I had suggested earlier also that the pantry management should be made responsible to maintain the intact menu card display in each cubicle, should be monitored by Ray. Authority with strictness. I could provide the image of the scratched menu card of B3 coach.
